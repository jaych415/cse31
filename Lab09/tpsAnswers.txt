TPS 1

1. Download “MIPS_Reference_Sheet” from CatCourses. We will need to refer to this sheet to 
complete all the exercises in this lab.
---
Done

2. Load proc1.s in MARS and study the code. This is similar to compare.s from Lab 06.
---
Done

3. After assembling the program, study the Text Segment window and see how your source code is 
translated into True Assembly Language (Basic) as well as machine code (Code).
---
Done

4. In true assembly language, every single instruction can be translated into a machine instruction. How 
many bits does a machine instruction contain?
---
Each machine instruction contains 32 bits. MARS shows the machine code in hexadecimal format with 8 digits.
This represents 8 x 4 = 32 digits in bit format.

5. To utilize the limited number of bits efficiently, all machine instructions are categorized into different 
types (or formats). How many types are there? What are they? Give 2 operations for each type as 
examples.
---
There are three different types of machine instructions: R-type, I-type, and J-type.
R-type: add, sub
I-type: lw, sw
J-type: j, jal

6. Now, locate the instruction in line #7 of proc1.s. Let us translate this instruction into machine code.  
a. What instruction type is this? How many fields does this type of instruction have? What are the
names of these fields?
---
MIPS code: addi $s0, $zero, 25
Instruction type: I-type
Number of fields: 4
Field names: opcode, rs, rt, immediate

b. Refer to the MIPS sheet, what is the value of the opcode of this instruction in hex? What register 
is rs? What is the value of this register in hex? What register is rt? What is the value of this register 
in hex? What is the value of immediate in hex?
---
opcode of addi in hex: 8
register rs: $zero aka $0
value of $zero in hex: 0x0
register rt: $s0
value of $s0 in hex: 0x10
value of immediate in hex: 0x19

c. Construct the machine code of line #7 using the values obtained from part b. Write your answer in 
both binary and hex formats. You can verify your answer with the Code column in Text Segment 
window.
---
machine code in binary: 0010 0000 0001 0000 0000 0000 0001 1001
machine code in hex: 0x20100019

7. Now, let us convert a machine code to a MIPS instruction. Locate address 0x00400010 from the Text 
Segment window.
a. What is the machine code at this address in hex? Convert this code into binary.
---
address 0x00400010 in decimal: 4194320
address 4194320: line 14 slt $t0, $s1, $s0
machine code in hex: 0x0230402a
machine code in binary: 0000 0010 0011 0000 0100 0000 0010 1010

b. From the binary version of this machine code. What is the instruction type? How can you tell? How 
many fields are there in this instruction type? What are the names of these fields?
---
machine code in binary: 000000 10001 10000 01000 00000 101010
The instruction type is R-type. I can tell this because the first 6 bits are all 0s.
field names: opcode, rs, rt, rd, shamt, funct

c. According to the binary machine code, what is the value of each field in hex?
---
opcode in hex: 0x0
rs in hex: 0x11
rt in hex: 0x10
rd in hex: 0x8
shamt in hex: 0x0
funct in hex: 0x2a

d. Refer to the MIPS sheet, what operation is this instruction? How can you tell? What is the mapping 
of the registers being used in this instruction?
---
This instruction is the slt operation. I can tell because the funct field is 2a in hex which the MIPS
Reference Sheet tells me is slt.
rs = $s1
rt = $s0
rd = $t0

e. What is the final MIPS instruction? Is it the same as the Source Column in the Text Segment 
window?
---
slt $t0, $s1, $s0
This is the same as the Source Column in the Text Segment

8. Now, let us take a look at line #17 of proc1.s.
a. What format is this instruction?
---
Line 17: bne $t0, $zero, LESS
This instruction is an I-type instruction.

b. What are the values of opcode, rs, and rt of this instruction in hex?
---
opcode in hex: 0x5
rs in hex: 0x8
rt in hex: 0x0

c. What is the name of the target label if it takes the branch? What is the address of this label in hex? 
(Hint: you can find it in the Text Segment window.)
---
The target label is called LESS. The address of LESS in hex is 0x40001C

d. So, do we put this address as the value of the immediate field of the instruction? Why?
---
No. The immediate stored as the target address is only 16 bits long, not the full 32-bit
address. Instead, the immediate field stores the offset of the addresses between the next
instruction and the target label.

e. How do we find the value of the immediate field? What is this value?
---
The value of the immediate field is the leftmost 16 bits of the 32-bit instruction.
0000 0000 0000 0001 = 0x1
The offset from the instruction after the branch to LESS is only 4 bytes. We can 
calculate the address by appending 00 to the immediate field and then adding the
address of PS + 4.

f. What is the machine code of this instruction in binary and hex formats? Does your answer match 
the Code column in the Text Segment window?
---
machine code in binary: 0001 0101 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001
machine code in hex: 0x15000001

9. Finally, let us convert the j instruction in line #20.
a. What format is this instruction? How many fields are there in this format?
---
This instruction is a J-type.
This instruction has two fields, opcode and address.

b. What is the opcode of this instruction in hex?
---
opcode in hex: 0x2

c. To what label and address does this instruction jump?
---
The target label is GREQ at address 0x00400030

d. How many bits can you use in the address field of the instruction? How can we “squeeze” the 
address into this field? What are the reasons behind this approach? What is the value of the 
address field in binary?
---
The address field can hold 26 bits. We can squeeze the address into this field by removing
the last two 0s as well as the first four bits, turning a 32-bit address into a 26-bit address.
The compiler reconstructs the address by appending the two 0s again and then prepending the address
with the first four bits of the PC, under the assumption that the jump distance is not too big.
The value of the address field in binary is 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 0011 00.

e. What is the machine code of this instruction in binary and hex? Is it the same as what’s in the 
Code Column of the Text Segment window?
---
machine code in hex: 0x0810000c
machine code in binary: 0000 1000 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 1100
