Activity #1:
1. This was done.
2. This was done.
3. This was done.
4. li $v0, 5
   syscall
   add $t3, $0, $v0
5. No, didn't need the declaration for n, nor the la and lw commands. 
6. This was done.

Activity #2:
1. When 5 is entered, the output is 29. I believe this can be verified by everyone else's answer to this question. 
2. This was done.
3. This was done.
4. Register $a0.
5. I expect it to be returned in $v0. Because of this we can simply move the returned value into $a0, that way we can replace the value in $v0 to perform the correct syscall. 
6. This was done.
7. This is enough space reserved for 3 integers. It's currently not reserving any integer values in this storage. 
8. This was done.
9. This was done.
10. We would have to save this value because we need to keep track of how large the number is since we're adding up their values at the end. 
11. This was done.
12. It'll have a incorrect value for $a0. Therefore we need to restore it to it's original value from when this iteration of the recursion call was made. 
13. This was done.
14. This was done.
15. It is the return address that we first saved when we first called the recursion function.
