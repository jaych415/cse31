    1.​ The three memory pools are the stack (for local variables), the heap (for dynamically
         allocated memory), and the static/global segment (for global and static variables).
    2.​ A: There are three variables declared: num, ptr, and handle.
       ​ B: Two variables are pointers: ptr, which points to an integer array on the heap, and
       handle, which points to an integer pointer on the heap.
​        C: All these variables are stored on the stack.
​        D: In line 12, ptr is set to point to memory allocated on the heap.
    3.​ This was done in a notebook and drawn out.
    4.​ Arrows were used to connect them as well.

TPS 2

    1.​ The program defines a Node structure and allocates memory for one Node on the heap
        then initializes its integer and float values. It sets up a basic node for a linked list,
        although the next pointer remains the same.
    2.​ You can add printf statements to print the value of head and the addresses of head,
        head->iValue, head->fValue, and head->next using the %p format specifier.
    3.​ The addresses of the structure's members are stored in the same memory, and the
        pointer head holds the address of the beginning of this block, directly referencing the
        entire Node structure.
