TPS 1
1. A cache can be used to reduce the average cost to access data from the main memory. It's smaller, faster, and located closer to a processor core, which stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations. The cache is needed to make accessing data from memory a lot faster. 
2. This was completed.
3. This was completed.
4. 4 bits for 16B. log_2(blockSize) is the function for number of bits in offset given blocksize. No it is not practical because it would store 4 bytes of data for only 1 byte.
5. 6 bits; log_2(blocks)
6. Yes: sizeofcache = numberofblocks * blocksize
7. Use them as a tag in order to identify what data is in the cache
8. 
	a. 2^20 = 1048575
	b. 3
	c. 16
	d. 4
	e. 13 bits -> 20-3-4
	f. DONE
	g. 13 tag+ 1v+ 1d+8*8=79

TPS 2:
1. Each of the blocks in the main memory maps to a fixed location in the cache, therefore, if there are 2 different blocks map to the same location and are continually referenced, the 2 blocks will continually swap in and out.
2. This was completed.
3. 2^10/2^2 log_2(2^10/2^2) = 8 bits; sets = numberofblocks/blocksize log_2(sets) = indexbits
4. 
	a. 2^20 = 1,048,576
	b. 3
	c. 16
	d. 8 
	e. 3
	f. 14
	g. DONE
	h. 14 + 1 + 1 + 8 * 8 = 80
