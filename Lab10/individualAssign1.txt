1. My CPU has the following 4 caches L1D, L1I, L2U, and L3U
2. I think it would be L1D = 32 KB, L1I = 32 KB, L2 = 256 KB, L3 = 9 MB
3. 64B for all 4
4. L1D = 8 associative, L1I = 8 associative, L2 = 4 associative, L3 = 14 associative
5. tag = 20B index = 6B, offset = 6B
6. There would be 20 tag bits, 6 index bits and 6 offset bits for this section.
